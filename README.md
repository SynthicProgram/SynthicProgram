## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid software and game developer in my second-year at UCI, majoring in Computer Science B.S.

I have years of experience establishing a game studio and community of over 15,000 members from the ground up with my development team. We successfully launched our cross-platform (PC, Mobile, Console, VR) video game in Spring 2024, where it reached 60K daily active and 300K monthly active users, currently with 5 million plays.

Now applying myself in full stack development as well, I'm excited to gain more experience and broaden my skills even further over the upcoming years!
